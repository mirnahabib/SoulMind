        <b>Purpose of SoulMind</b></h2>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-size:20px; font-family:Century Gothic ;color: #2823b5 ; margin: 2.5%;">
        In a society in which people are expected to work long hours and pass on vacation days, 
        there is an underlying belief that we must always be productive â€“ which can ultimately take away from opportunities for self-care.<br> 
        But by taking some time out to engage in self-care, you may relieve the pressures of everyday life and reset yourself to get back 
        to a healthy point where productivity is once again maximized. <br>
        Considering the costs associated with mental health services, lost wages and more, 
        spending some time on yourself may ultimately benefit everyone.<br>

        Burning the candle at both ends, so-to-speak, comes with significant consequences, which may include but are not limited to burnout, 
        depression, anxiety, resentment and a whole host of other negative implications. <br>
        Engaging in a self-care routine has been clinically proven to reduce or eliminate anxiety and depression, 
        reduce stress, improve concentration, minimize frustration and anger, increase happiness, improve energy, and more.<br>
        From a physical health perspective, self-care has been clinically proven to reduce heart disease, stroke and cancer. <br>
        Spiritually, it may help keep us in tune with our higher power as well as realize our meaning in life.<br>
